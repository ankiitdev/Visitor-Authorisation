# Visitor-Authorisation
This is an app for my B.Tech final year project titled Visitor Authorisation System. The app will be connected to Raspberry pi and fetching info of visitors from the cloud. Currently for testing purposes, I've connected it to node mcu for contolling it's pins via REST api using this app.
